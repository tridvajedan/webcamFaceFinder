# Java Webcam Face Finder

This is a Java project that utilizes OpenCV to detect faces on a live webcam feed. It applies a green square overlay on the detected faces, providing a real-time visual indication of the detected regions.
How it Works

The Webcam Face Finder project leverages the power of OpenCV's computer vision library to detect faces in a video stream from a webcam. It follows these steps:

    Accesses the live video stream from the webcam using OpenCV.
    Applies face detection algorithms to analyze the video frames.
    Identifies and locates faces within the frames.
    Draws a green square overlay on each detected face.
    Continuously updates the video feed with the overlays in real-time.

# Getting Started

To run the Webcam Face Finder project, follow the steps below:

    Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
    Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
    Set up OpenCV for Java on your system. You can refer to the official OpenCV documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.
    Add the necessary OpenCV library files to your project's dependencies.
    Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
    Compile and run the project.
    The webcam feed will appear in a window, with green squares overlaid on any detected faces.

# Dependencies
